Through a commitment to the overall product showcased through a dedication to problem-solving and adherence to adapting planning documents, I ensure that my program is functional and secure. Furthermore, researching the best practices for the relevant coding products will always be an easy way to create a secure and functional code. I believe that clear and precise conversations with users streamline incorporating their needs into the program and will create a satisfying product. While balancing what’s possible and what’s desired, development teams should strive to explain technical hurdles in simplistic terms to users and aim to work through the problems together. I approach designing software with the future in mind and attempt to mitigate any potential problems at the beginning through a detailed planning phase. As new and unexpected issues arise, problems should be created with the original planning documents and new user input in mind.
